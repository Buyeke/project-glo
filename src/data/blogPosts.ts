# Meet the Founder: Dinah Buyeke Masanda

Dinah Buyeke Masanda is the founder of Glo, an AI-powered platform connecting homeless women and children in Kenya to trauma-informed care and support services. Her work represents a powerful intersection of technology, social justice, and community empowerment.

## A Vision Rooted in Care

Dinah's approach to technology is fundamentally different. She believes in building inclusive, ethical technologies that are rooted in care and community rather than profit and extraction. Her research interests span gendered power dynamics, digital equity, Afro-feminist urban design, and the intersection of AI and social justice.

## Academic Excellence and Recognition

As a 2024 OBREAL & AAU Fellow, Dinah brings academic rigor to her practical work of reimagining how systems serve vulnerable communities. Her fellowship represents recognition of her innovative approach to combining technology with social justice advocacy.

## The Poet-Technologist

Beyond her work in technology and social justice, Dinah is also a poet. This creative practice informs her approach to building technology that serves humanity with dignity and cultural understanding. Her poetry and technology work share a common thread: reimagining how we relate to each other and the systems that shape our lives.

## A Mother's Perspective

As a mother, Dinah brings personal understanding to the challenges faced by women and children in vulnerable situations. This lived experience shapes Project Glo's trauma-informed approach and community-centered design philosophy.

## Research and Advocacy

Dinah's research focuses on several interconnected areas:

- **Gendered Power Dynamics**: Examining how gender shapes access to and design of technology
- **Digital Equity**: Working to ensure technology serves everyone, especially the marginalized
- **Afro-Feminist Urban Design**: Reimagining city spaces through an Afro-feminist lens
- **AI and Social Justice**: Building ethical AI systems that advance equity

## Partnerships and Collaboration

Under Dinah's leadership, Project Glo has developed meaningful partnerships with The Co-operative University of Kenya and OBREAL (Spain), demonstrating her commitment to collaborative, community-based approaches to social change.

## Philosophy and Approach

Dinah is committed to reimagining how systems serve and who they're built for. Her work with Project Glo exemplifies this philosophy, creating technology that prioritizes the needs and dignity of the most vulnerable while advancing broader goals of social justice and equity.

Through Project Glo, Dinah continues to demonstrate that technology can be a force for care, community, and justice when it is built with intention, empathy, and deep respect for the communities it serves.
