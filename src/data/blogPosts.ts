    content: `As we approach the end of our first year under the OBREAL Global and Association of African Universities (AAU) incubator, the Glo team is both reflective and excited.

What began as a bold ideaâ€”to use AI to support homeless women and childrenâ€”has grown into a working platform connecting users to emergency shelter, mental health care, legal aid, and other life-saving services. Through our bilingual chatbot, simplified booking system, and partner collaborations in Mombasa and beyond, we've served dozens of vulnerable users seeking dignity, safety, and hope.

In recent months, we've expanded features, added service provider logins, and are now testing our smart matching and rota-based booking engine. Behind the scenes, we're working on data privacy safeguards, Google Calendar integration, and improved accessibility for mobile users.

We're deeply grateful to OBREAL and AAU for the opportunity to turn this vision into actionâ€”and for believing that innovation and empathy can co-exist in Africa's response to homelessness and gendered vulnerability.

As we close Year 1, we're preparing our final reports, polishing our UX, and laying foundations to scale sustainably. Glo is growingâ€”and we're just getting started.

Stay tuned for what's next. ðŸ’›`,
